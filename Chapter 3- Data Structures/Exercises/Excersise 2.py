#Start with the list you used in Exercise 1, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

names = ["Adhenz", "Nathan", "Patrick", "Raven"]

print("This is my friend", names[0])
print("This is my friend", names[1])
print("This is my friend", names[2])
print("This is my friend", names[3])
